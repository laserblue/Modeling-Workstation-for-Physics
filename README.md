# Corporate/domain Memory

A database of A.I. retrieved, short video clips (max: 5 mins.) of professional physicists and mathematical physicists or mathematicians relating physics profession "war" stories from working daily life. (see Socratic Arts™ ExTRA™ (Experts Telling Relevant Information) knowledge management system.(https://www.socraticarts.com/solution?solution=extra&id=17))

NOT TO BE BROWSED. 
    
    All video clips relevant to inquiries will be retrieved by an automated A.I. system that knows what is being worked on and what the inquiry is about.
