# old-school Physics Topics and Courses 

## old-school University physics textbooks and lecture hall videos
This is to be a parallel, viewing, comparison and melting pot for the old-school live or video lecturing and assigned textbook physics courses
It's basically a museum and I am not very keen on emulating much of it or even curating the content. 

This material is out there and should be accessible to the modeling workstation conversational reader, search agents and cognitive assistant. 
One use of the table of content headings is to make the search interface more graphical/visual than a text-based search input field or OpenAI chatGPT text chat. 
An excellent example is the HyperPhysics Concepts map (http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/index.html) or an old Yahoo Physics subject search directory tree.
The searcher should be made aware of possible lines of inquiry and not have to be an expert that knows all the branches of physics etc.

A conversational reading system should have a tooltip word definition glossary as standard and then the eight or so categories of well-indexed questions and zoomers that make the 
content more transparent and accessible without actually giving everything away in a document, scientific paper, book or video. 

There are some pedagogical things that could be transferred into ASK hypermedia systems. However, a modeling workstation for physics is not going to revolve around text.

I want parallel listings of tables of contents of University physics textbooks for BSc Physics courses from Universities and then MSc and PhD

I want to steer clear of the live lecture and textbook educational methodology as its like reading a book when you can use a flight simulator or filming a broadway play of Star Wars and calling it a feature film.
It's like using pencil and paper to add numbers when you have Excel in front of you on a laptop and can transfer a data collection file electronically.

The author of a marine geology textbook, Roger Anderson wrote that his students erroneously thought that science was a quiz game. David Hestenes said much the same in his paper on modeling in the Newtonian World.


I want to text mine course syllabi and course descriptions, textbook indices, DBpedia linked open data etc. as well, for vocabulary, ontology and to get an idea of not just content/knowledge but skills being developed.



David Hestenes pointed out in his Oersted Medal Lecture that there is quite a bit of redundancy in the math being used by physicists. 
The math redundancy still exists in 2024 and in Principles of Physics (2013).

PHYS 2496  Mathematical Physics 1  3 cr  
This course provides a continuation of the mathematics required for both the Honours and Major programs in Physics and Astronomy. Topics include sequences and series, an introduction to complex numbers, special functions, ordinary differential equations, Fourier series and transforms, and an introduction to probability and statistics. May not be held with PHYS 2490.

PR/CR: A minimum grade of C is required unless otherwise indicated.
Prerequisites: [PHYS 1050 or PHYS 1051] or [a "C+" or better in PHYS 1020 or PHYS 1021] and [one of MATH 1232, MATH 1690, MATH 1700, MATH 1701, or MATH 1710]. Pre- or corequisite: one of PHYS 1070, PHYS 1071, PHYS 1030, PHYS 1031, or PHYS 2152.

Mutually Exclusive: PHYS 2490

Tables of contents of General Physics textbooks for medical students etc. 

one of the differences between the honors physics with calculus textbooks and the general liberal arts textbooks is a first chapter on dimensional analysis

In the mid 1980's I read an article pointing out how standardized physics textbooks had become and in the early to mid 1990's Eugen Merzbacher gave a speech in American Journal of Physics vol. 60 no. 4 where he stated that there wasn't much difference between a textbook from the 1870's and the 1990's vintage.

I want to create a physics ontology, controlled vocabulary etc. as well as make use of existing physics and science ontologies and vocabularies, subject headings etc.

#### Principles of Physics by Serway and Jewett (5th Ed., 2013, 2006, 2002)
31 chapters
    This is pretty close to the pinnacle of paper-based textbooks. It is jam packed with features trying to cater to several different audiences/publics such as 
physicists, engineers, medical students, and bio/life scientists. It has over 1000 large pages (8.5 in. x 11 in. ???).The margins are often filled with tidbits.pg. 53 has an empty right-side margin a student could write in.

It has a very large number of pedagogical features but the online resources are just spillover into the digital world that don't really take advantage of what can be done with computers in the 21st century.
e.g. e-textbooks that are not much different than the printed versions and like putting textbook text on a billboard in second life. The number of truly "interactive" simulations isn't large.


e.g. homework web assign
    the word "interactive" can be seen but doesn't really mean much more than multiple choice quiz selecting and assignment of problems to solve. 

"interactive" tutoring software, exercise software, etc. that is basically memorization of content


MCAT Test Preparation Guide
Life Science Applications and Problems

The Khan Academy exercise software and video tutorials are really only a small step up into the digital world. While the internet and YouTube didn't exist in the 1970's and 1980's, the basic idea was out there
e.g. electronic quiz machines, R. Buckminster Fuller's 42 hour "Everything I know" video tapes, documentary films, videos of lectures etc.

H.G. Wells was talking about reforming live lecturing at Universities with mass produced books in 1921. Universities were still live lecturing in the 1980's and until 2024. 
One professor said he used one textbook as the source of his lectures while assigning a different textbook to his students. Yeah, clickers are a major pedagogical breakthrough.

The problems faced by Albert Einstein when he was in University in the 1890's have never really been dealt with.
1. Einstein complained about the gap between what was being taught and what was being done on the frontier of physics. Grossmann took notes while Einstein read up on contemporary work
2.  Einstein complained of the amount of rote memorization involved so that he was sick of physics after his final exams.

Modern Physics isn't that modern. 
the mathematical formalism is not unified so students will need to abandon it in favour of several redundant formalisms in existence such as tensors, differential forms, spinors etc.
This is one main thing David Hestenes was tring to work on with "Geometric Algebra" and "Geometric Calculus" as a unified mathematical formalism for physics and mathematics

In terms of use of textbooks in a supervised courseroom of the 1950's and 1960's, Principle of Physics does not have a course checksheet of activities nor a full glossary.
